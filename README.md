Medicaid Presentation derived from AWS data connection and presented with Tableau

This project proposes an answer to the question of how the New York State Hospital System can best allocate resources to its respective hospitals within the five boroughs of New York City. Using data uploaded from Amazon Web Services, with appropriate visualizations in Tableau, it examines the eight most common types of major diagnostic categories that result in emergency room visits and hospitalizations. The data comes from “Medicaid Chronic Conditions, Inpatient Admissions and Emergency Room Visits by ZIP Code: Beginning in 2012.“ The study  effectively ends in 2014.
